      <p class="col-md-9" style="color:#283E5D;">One of my hobbies, which isn't necessarily a hobby, is watching movies
        and tv shows. I spend lots of time on my phone but it's mainly spent on Netflix and YouTube. Watching TV is one
        of the ways I can disconnect and relax after being stressed out and also if I just feel like it. Some of my
        favorite shows to watch are Bob's Burgers, Young Sheldon, Glee, Ugly Betty, The Office, Bojack Horseman, Gilmore
        Girls, and tons of others but these are just some of my favorites. Along with watching TV shows I adore watching
        movies as well. Some of those movies are Girl Interrupted, Pitch Perfect, Black Swan, La La Land, 10 Things I
        Hate About You, Napoleon Dynamite, and just so many more. Watching TV is a comfort for me and I just get a rush
        of dopamine every time one comes on, I just love all of it.</p>

      <img class="col-md-3" style="border:dashed white;" src="media/vgamepic.png" alt="vidgamepic">
      <p class="col-md-9" style="color:white;">Another one of my hobbies is playing video games. I like playing video
        games because they're fun to me and it's a way I get to connect with my friends. Some video games I enjoy
        playing are Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Stardew Valley, and a couple more, but I don't play them as much and I
        forget about them. I just like how games can give me something else to worry about and let me do what I like. I
        find it soothing, mostly, and I enjoy spending time with friends as I play games with them, because I love them
        and love doing anything and everything with them. Play games is just a whole nother experience and I greatly admire the creation of them. Games are just one way I connect with other people and I feel privileged to be able to play them.</p>

      <h2 style="color:#283E5D; text-align: center;">Reading</h2>
      <img class="col-md-3" style="border:dashed #283E5D;" src="media/bookpicreal.png" alt="readingpic">
      <p class="col-md-9" style="color:#283E5D;">Yet another one of my hobbies is reading. The words written on the pages
        just immediately come to life and that completely immerses me into the book. A favorite of mine is The Maid by
        Nita Prose, it's a mystery and I just loved all of it. Literature can do so many things that are unimaginable to
        the human eye and it's a wondrous thing how people create such beautiful and amazing stories using their words.
        It's quite literally one of the best parts about the world, the creation of language, the use of imagtion, and
        the written stories shared to all. Reading is something that I do when I can and it's a great past time. I'd
        reccommend reading to anyone who doesn't like it, maybe you just haven't found the right book yet, and finding
        that start point is where it all begins.</p>

      <h2 style="color:white; text-align: center;">Listening To Music</h2>
      <img class="col-md-3" style="border:dashed white;" src="media/musicpic.png" alt="musicpic">
      <p class="col-md-9" style="color:white">Lastly, one of my few other hobbies is listening to music! I spend lots of
        time listening to music, like this year, Spotify recorded that I listened for around 90,000 minutes all year.
        Music is something I use to calm my nerves or keep me focused, or distracted, from whatever I'm doing, I also
        listen to it to fill the silence. Music is a form of media that I closely relate to, it puts my thoughts into
        words and describes everything I'm feeling. Some artists I listen to are Lana Del Rey, Cigarettes After Sex,
        Black Box Recorder, Sixpence None The Richer, Faye Webster, Billie Eilish, Suki Waterhouse, Tommy Genesis, and a
        few other artists that also fit into this category. I just adore all their music and how they each have their
        own kind of style and way of writing to portray the message of their song. Music is my everything and I don't
        know what I'd do without it.</p>
